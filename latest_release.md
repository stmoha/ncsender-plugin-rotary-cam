## Rotary CAM 0.9.7 (beta)

**New in 0.9.7**
- **Indexed asks which way A turns.** Indexed cuts from the side, so if A turns the other way from the "A+90 moves the top of the stock to" setting, it lands on the opposite side: 180° off at A90 and A270. Roughing and finishing only come out mirrored. Until you've confirmed the direction, a program with Indexed asks you to mark the top of the stock, jog A+90, and pick *Toward me (−Y)* or *Away from me (+Y)*. Picking the other way flips the setting and drops the toolpaths so you generate again. Tested both ways: the simulation of an Indexed program cuts what it should with A turning either way.

**Since 0.2.0**
- 0.9.6: progress you can follow, more cores, inch programs only with A set as rotary ($376), a note on calibrating A
- 0.9.5: the Z travel limit holds still while you shorten stickouts; what's left once every tool fits
- 0.9.4: one Z travel message with the most a tool may stick out and how to check it, stickout of the tool in the spindle, one stickout per tool number, stock length + clamping distance, live centre total length, the chuck end and tailstock end fade when they're in the way, silver / dark gray setup
- 0.9.3: Z not zeroed on the axis yet (or not homed) no longer blocks Generate
- 0.9.2: open windows pick up changes made on another computer before generating, loading or saving
- 0.9.1: programs stay inside the Z travel, stock at a glance in the header, version and update badge, settings that survive reopening and two computers
- 0.9.0: Indexed planning around 7× faster (own exact ball drop-cutter, drops on every worker), listed angles by default
- 0.8.0: work zero from a corner of the rotary (Move zero to the rotary axis), G-code zero marked in 3D, 4-jaw chuck, see-through spindle, tenon length
- 0.7.1: settings light up their part of the 3D setup with a dimension; headstock and tailstock reach front and back separately
- 0.7.0: collet nut, spindle and the rotary checked in every operation, per-tool stickout, tool changes routed round the rotary using ncSender's G54 / Manual Tool Changer / Safe Z, Simulate checks the holder, holder-aware Indexed angles
- 0.6.0: project files (.rcam), Indexed angles in 3D (see what each can reach, drag to change), scale / scale to fit the stock
- 0.5.0: Indexed (3+1) cleanup of what the rotary passes miss, tapered ball bits, tenons, what's left to clean shown in the simulation
- 0.4.0: Corners operation for square stock, Parting, Simulate, toolpaths that reach the ends of the part, no tool change for the same tool number
- 0.3.0: full-window layout, ncSender's units (inch fields and G20 programs), reopens where you left off, square / rectangular stock, colour-matched operation buttons, live 3D updates, tooltips, new icon
- 0.2.0: 3D view for placing the part, toolpaths drawn on the part, extra points on sharp features
